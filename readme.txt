Show the origin of a action or filter hook sequentially which helps a developer to debug quickly.

== Description ==

A sequential and visual representation of WordPress action and filter hooks. Up until now, the way theme and plugin developers find where to hook into with their add_action() and add_filter() functions is either to search through the WordPress codebase or find a reference to the hook in the codex.

What Show Hooks does is give you a simpler way to see these hooks by displaying them in-line on the page that you are on. All that's left to do then is copy the hook you need, and paste it into your add_action and add_filter functions like this:

add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_enqueue_scripts_action' );
add_filter( 'the_title', 'my_the_title_filter' );

I made this plugin so I could find WordPress hooks quicker and I use it all the time, so I thought I'd share it and see if it could help others.

Enjoy!üòá

Please note that in odd cases, due to the nature of actions and filters, the plugin may display a hook in place that disrupts the display of your site - in which case we always display the 'Hide Hooks' button so you can switch it back off. This won't disrupt the look of your site to anyone but you so don't worry.
